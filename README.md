This is a take-home challenge for the role of data analyst from a mid size tech company in Europe which is doing similar business as Meituan. 

The take-home challenge is using the data from this research project initiated by Meituan. It is focusing on answering two questions:

a. Is there anything to improve for the PtoD (placement to delivery) process?

b. What are the factors that make riders reject the orders?

The candidate is supposed to give a presentation on the findings. 

I presented a basic solution for tackling these two questions, but not good enough, as it is not a sample answer from a successful candidate, the purpose of this repo is only for sharing.
